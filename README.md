## 🎮 Fun With Passphrases

Generate a single passphrase:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp
```

Generate 20 colorized passphrases:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp -co -n 20
```

Smush 5 words together per passphrase:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp -co -n 20 -nw 5
```

Use the Augenbaum method with parameter `5@`:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp -co -n 20 -au 5@
```

Generate 32-character passphrases:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp -co -n 20 -c 32
```

Display help:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp -h
```

Use Wikipedia as a source with verbose output:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp -co -w -v
```

Wikipedia + multiple passphrases:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp -co -w -n 10
```

Check a passphrase against breaches:
```bash
python hwtp.py pp -co -pwn
```

Check a specific password:
```bash
python hwtp.py pwn f00tl00se
```

## 🔐 Fun With Passwords

Colorized, 20 passwords with lots of filters:
```bash
python hwtp.py pw -co -nc -n 20 -no l u s -v
```

10-character passwords, tightly controlled:
```bash
python hwtp.py pw -co -nc -n 20 -c 10 -v -no l -md 4 -ms 4 -a -x -b
```

Bookended, balanced, and secure:
```bash
python hwtp.py pw -co -nc -ms 3 -md 3 -b -n 20 -c 8 -v
```

🔴 Example of a configuration that **won't work**:
```bash
python hwtp.py pw -co -nc -ms 4 -md 4 -b -n 20 -c 8 -v
```

Limit character sets with exclusions:
```bash
python hwtp.py pw -co -n 10 -no u l d -sd '@ # $ _ & ( ) / : ; ! ? - ='
```

Or whitelist specific special characters:
```bash
python hwtp.py pw -co -n 10 -no u l d -so '@ # $ ='
```
